Having an **embedded media** (photos and video) is often inflexible with a dynamic and **responsive design**.

### Embed your video like this:
{: .left}

{% highlight html linenos=table %}
<div class="icontain">
  <iframe src="//https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBnNxneA_A" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

It'll play like this funny video below! Try resizing the page!

Photo layouts are also really cool and dynamically resizable. Check out the photos/gallery section at [magiciansanfrancisco.com](http://magiciansanfrancisco.com) for a demo and see [the source code](https://github.com/strongrobert/MagicianSanFrancisco) for how.

<div class="icontain"><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VkBnNxneA_A" title="Education Videos - Education Free Stock Videos - Education Free Stock Footage" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
